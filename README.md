# Slide-Extractor
Extracts slides from videos of ppt presentations rather than a single video
## How to run
1. put your videos of ppt presentations into the folder `input_video`
2. run `slides.py` with 
   ```
    python slides.py
   ```
   you can be informed of the progress from the output progressbar
3. when the progress is done, you can check the folder `output_slide` which contains the extracted slides
4. you may need to select the slides since the code will capture any difference between frames in videos
